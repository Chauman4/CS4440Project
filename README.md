The link to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-traffic-collision-data. We added this dataset in the repo as a compressed zip file since the dataset is 174 MB, which exceeds the max size, 100 MB, of a file that can be added in GitHub. To use the dataset, extract the dataset from the zip folder and then run the python script in database.py.
